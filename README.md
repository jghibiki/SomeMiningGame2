# Some Mining Game V2

A re-implementation of my [2017 NDSU ACM SIG-GDev end of year competition project](https://github.com/jghibiki/SigGDevCompetition2017), this time in Unity.

The basic premise of the game is a rudimentary RTS worker management game in the vein of Rimworld or Dwarf Fortress. Unfortunately the Unity version does not have feature pairity with the original python version, however it runs much more efficiently.
